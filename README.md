"Embarking on a solo online internship with Codsoft in the realm of Artificial Intelligence has been a transformative journey. Despite the virtual setting, the experience was anything but isolated.Facilitated seamless learning and project execution. Working independently on AI projects from the comfort of my space allowed for focused exploration of machine learning, deep learning, and AI applications. The virtual collaboration with Codsoft's experts enhanced my problem-solving skills and provided valuable insights into the dynamic field of AI. Grateful for the enriching solo online internship experience at Codsoft, shaping my proficiency and passion for Artificial Intelligence.
1.CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED RESPONSES
The Task Was To Create A chatbot Which is Rules Based. A Rule-Based Chatbot is a type of chatbot that operates on predefined rules and patterns. Unlike more advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models that use machine learning and natural language processing to understand and respond to user inputs dynamically


The Particular That I made Is name as shubham chatbot on my name. I firstly Define the rules Which if ask will give responses as programmed. Then We Use The Condition Statement Here Where If the Condition or the user responses will be programmed in code Chatbot will Show the Response to the particular User Response and if the Response is not Programmed It will show I can't answer this. The Project was Really Fun Here I use India's predominant used language too along with English for responses. 

It was Really A fun Project to do as i can tweak as want with the responses. I personally combine Hindi with responses and made chatbot to call my friend. And set a response to the command 

2.TIC-TAC-TOE AI
Implement an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe 
against a human player. With Minimax Algorithm with Alpha Beta Pruning


The Particular one Was for Tic-Tac-Toe a classic game we integrate the minimax algorithm to make the game unbeatable against the human. The minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm commonly used in two-player, zero-sum games, such as chess or tic-tac-toe. Its primary objective is to determine the optimal strategy for a player to maximize their chances of winning while minimizing potential losses. The algorithm explores possible moves by both players to find the best move for the current player, assuming that the opponent will also make optimal moves. The minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning is an enhanced version of the standard minimax algorithm used in two-player, zero-sum games. Alpha-beta pruning is a technique that reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree by eliminating branches that cannot affect the final decision. This optimization helps improve the algorithm's efficiency.

It was Really A fun Project to do and the most easy task out of all 5 task
3.RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
We had Created a simple recommendation system that suggests items to 
users based on their preferences. Using collaborative filtering technic.


A simple book recommendation system is a algorithm designed to suggest books to users based on their preferences or characteristics of books. The goal is to provide users with personalized recommendations that align with their interests, making it more likely for them to discover and enjoy new books.

The Particular that i have made is made using a technique know as collaborative Filtering. The Data is a open source which was freely available on kaggle.com to download the ide here we use was anaconda not pycharm because we have to deal with database using jupyter notebook available in anaconda. Collaborative filtering is a recommendation technique that suggests items (such as books, movies, or products) to users based on the preferences and behaviors of similar users. It operates under the assumption that users who have similar tastes in the past will likely have similar preferences in the future. There are two main types of collaborative filtering:

It was Really A fun Project to do and the most hard task as i had never deal with jupyter notebook it was really a new learning experience
